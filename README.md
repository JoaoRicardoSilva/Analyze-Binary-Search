# Analyze Binary Search
A Javascript Binary Search algorithm and analyze its performance using Big O Notation.

## How the algorithm works
1. Create a function with two arguments (`num` and `arr`)
   * `num` is the number that we want to find
   * `arr` is an array where we will be looking
2. Create a variable `i`
   * `i` will be some index of the `arr`
   * The **Final Objective** is `i` === index of `num`
   * `i` = half of the length of `arr`
3. Execute a function that recive as argument the actual `index`. In this function we have 3 options:
   * `num` === `arr[index]`
      * We find it 
   * `num` < `arr[index]`
      *  
   * `num` > `arr[index]`
